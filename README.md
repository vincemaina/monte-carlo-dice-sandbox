# Monte Carlo Dice Simulation ðŸŽ²

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that visualises a **Monte Carlo simulation** for rolling dice.
The simulation repeatedly rolls a set of dice and visualises the probability distribution of different sums over time.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time Monte Carlo simulation of dice rolls
- Interactive controls for configuring the number of dice, iterations, and speed
- Live-updating probability distribution graph
- Responsive UI built with Next.js

## How to Use

1. Enter the **number of dice** to roll per trial.
2. Set the **number of trials** (how many dice rolls to simulate).
3. Adjust the **max simulation speed** (rolls per second).
4. Click **"Run Simulation"** to start.
5. The graph will update in real-time to reflect probabilities.
6. Click **"Stop Simulation"** to halt the process.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js â€“ React framework for SSR and performance
- TypeScript â€“ Type safety and maintainability
- Recharts â€“ Data visualization for the probability distribution
- CSS/Tailwind â€“ UI styling
